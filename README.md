## close-unwanted-tabs

`close-unwanted-tabs` is a Chrome extension for closing some tabs of specific URLs.

You will definitely like this extension if you often find your browser tabs look like:

>G, SO, G, SO, [useful tab], SO, Blank, G, [useful tab], SO, BLANK, G, G, SO, ...

where `G` is 'Google search result', `SO` is 'Stack Overflow question', `BLANK` is 'blank tab'.

Expecially for programmers, sites like Google and Stack Overflow are roads that take you to the solutions. Oftentimes after useful destinations are approached, the roads need to be cleared. With this extension, that would be easy:

Just **one click to close:**

- Google search result pages
- stackoverflow question pages
- blank tabs

unless the tab is active or pinned.
