## close-unwanted-tabs

`close-unwanted-tabs` is a Chrome extension for closing some tabs of specific URLs.

You will definitely like this extension if you often find your browser tabs look like:

>G, SO, G, SO, [useful tab], SO, Blank, G, [useful tab], SO, BLANK, G, G, SO, ...

where `G` is 'Google search result', `SO` is 'Stack Overflow question', `BLANK` is 'blank tab'.

Expecially for programmers, sites like Google and Stack Overflow are paths that take you to the solutions. Oftentimes after useful destinations are approached, the paths need to be cleared. With this extension, that would be easy:

Just **one click to close:**

- URL begins with "chrome://" such as blank tabs, Chrome history
- Google search results
- stackoverflow question pages
- Search pages of Bing, Baidu
- Taobao & Tmall search and item pages

unless the tab is active or pinned.
